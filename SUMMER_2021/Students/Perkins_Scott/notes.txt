Format :
	Student led -- once a week -- 10-15 hours a week
Objectives:
	0. Learn python 
		-- object oriented programming (class hierarchy) 
		-- loose suggestions	
		-- pandas 
		-- astropy (constants and units)
		-- numpy 
		-- matplotlib
		-- scipy
	1. Run bilby tutorials
		1.0 which tutorials?	
			-- simple gaussian
			-- linear regression
			-- custom priors (Deep's repo)
	2. Rerun Neil 1 & 2 in Bilby
		2.1 Do Neil assignment 4 (PTMCMC) with bilby ptemcee -- maybe not fisher stuff though
		2.2 Understand temp spacing stuff
		2.3 Figure out checks
			-- plot chains 
			-- check mixing
			-- check Detailed Balance
			-- uninformative signal get prior back
			-- burn in 	
			-- AC 	
	3. Run some examples on cluster
		3.-1 Work through campus cluster tutorials
		3.0 Install software on cluster
		3.1 Hello world cluster job
		3.2 slurm commands -- submission script
		3.3 parallel jobs and multiple cores
		3.4 monitor jobs 
	4. Download the data
		3.0 Find data, hdf5, gwpy, PSD estimates and different ways to calculate them, PSD understanding
	5. Load 2 - 3 different waveform models and plot them (pycbc or LAL) 
	6. Run bilby on GW data (bilby tutorials)
		6.0 run gw170729 -- Taylor F2
		6.1 run in dynesty and ptemcee and compare and contrast
		6.2 Use LVC informed priors 
	7. Run bilby with modified waveforms
		--Two options so far
		7.0 Rewrite LALsuite c code and wrap in python
		7.1 Map ppE to gIMR and call lalsuite python code

TODO:
	0. figure out which bilby tutorials to do, what should be presented
